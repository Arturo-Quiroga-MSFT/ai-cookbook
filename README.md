## Azure OpenAI Cookbook - Extended from Dave Ebbelaar's AI Cookbook

This repository extends the excellent work by **Dave Ebbelaar** from his original [AI Cookbook](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/ai-cookbook). Dave's educational content and practical tutorials on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@daveebbelaar) provide invaluable insights into building real-world AI systems.

### Why Azure OpenAI Extensions Were Needed

Many organizations and developers work within Azure ecosystems and require:
- **Enterprise-grade security** with Azure's compliance and governance features
- **Managed Identity authentication** for secure, keyless access
- **Integration with existing Azure services** like Key Vault, Monitor, and App Services
- **Regional data residency** requirements for regulatory compliance
- **Cost optimization** through Azure's pricing models and enterprise agreements

### Azure OpenAI Additions

The following directories contain Azure OpenAI implementations of Dave's original concepts:

- **`Agents-Azure/`** - Agent building blocks using Azure OpenAI services, includes python code and notebooks
- **`patterns-Azure/`** - LLM workflow patterns adapted for Azure OpenAI, includes python code and notebooks
- **`mcp/crash-course/4a-azure-openai-integration/`** - Model Context Protocol integration with Azure OpenAI


All code maintains the same educational approach and practical focus as Dave's original work, while providing Azure-specific implementations with proper authentication, error handling, and production-ready patterns.
