# Design Patterns with Azure OpenAI

This section contains advanced design patterns for building robust AI systems with Azure OpenAI. These patterns focus on architectural approaches that ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability in production environments.

## Coming Soon

Advanced design patterns including:

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Preventing cascade failures in Azure OpenAI workflows
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolating Azure OpenAI services for fault tolerance  
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Resilient Azure OpenAI API interactions
- **Rate Limiting**: Managing Azure OpenAI usage and costs
- **Caching Strategies**: Optimizing Azure OpenAI response caching
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Tracking Azure OpenAI system health
- **Configuration Management**: Dynamic Azure OpenAI model and parameter management
- **Security Patterns**: Secure Azure OpenAI authentication and data handling

## Prerequisites

- Azure OpenAI service configured
